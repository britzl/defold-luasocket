# defold-luasocket
The LuaSocket .lua files, modified to play nicely with Defold (modified require calls for Lua base libraries). The project also provides the mime.core part of LuaSocket as a native extension, since it's not provided by Defold.

# Installation
You can use the extension in your own project by adding this project as a [Defold library dependency](http://www.defold.com/manuals/libraries/). Open your game.project file and in the dependencies field under project add:

# Usage
